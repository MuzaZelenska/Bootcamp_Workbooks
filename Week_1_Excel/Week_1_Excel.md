</h2>

I completed the **Just IT Data Technician Bootcamp**, where I learned how to work with data step by step.  
During the course, I practiced collecting, cleaning, and analysing datasets in **Excel**.  
I created **Pivot Tables**, used formulas like `SUM`, `AVERAGE`, `IF`, and `SWITCH`, and built clear charts and graphs to show trends and results.  
I also studied **data protection principles** such as **GDPR**, the **Data Protection Act**, and the **Computer Misuse Act**, learning how to handle information safely and responsibly.  

For the final project, I prepared and presented a **data analysis report** for an imaginary company that was losing customers.  
I analysed customer data, found key reasons for churn, suggested solutions, and presented my findings using visual charts and summaries.
