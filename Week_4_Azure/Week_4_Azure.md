# Week 4 Project - Microsoft Azure

During the fourth week of the **Just IT Data Technician Bootcamp**, I focused on learning about **Microsoft Azure** and how cloud services support modern data management.  
I studied different types of clouds (public, private, hybrid, community) and cloud service models such as **IaaS**, **PaaS**, and **SaaS**, learning how businesses use them in real-world situations.  
I also explored UK data protection laws including the **Computer Misuse Act**, **GDPR**, and the **Data Protection Act 2018**, understanding how they ensure the safe use of digital data.  

During the labs, I completed Azure learning paths on **relational**, **non-relational**, and **analytical data** in Azure.  
As part of a business scenario, I created a report for a small company called *“Paws & Whiskers”*, explaining how to migrate from Excel to Azure using services such as **Azure SQL Database**, **Azure Data Factory**, **Azure Blob Storage**, and **Power BI**.  
By the end of the week, I understood how to design secure cloud data systems, recommend Azure tools for different tasks, and ensure compliance with UK and EU regulations.
