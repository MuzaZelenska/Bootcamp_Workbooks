# GitHub Summary. Week 2 - Tableau and Power BI

During the second week of the **Just IT Data Technician Bootcamp**, I learned how to work with **Tableau** and **Power BI** for data visualisation and reporting.  
I researched the different versions of Tableau and created a dashboard using the **EMSI Job Change UK** dataset with charts and a UK map to show key locations.  
I also analysed the **Spotify** dataset to find patterns in music popularity, genres, and artists.

In **Power BI**, I completed a series of labs that covered importing and cleaning data, creating reports and dashboards, and using **DAX formulas** for calculations and time analysis.  
By the end of the week, I felt more confident in turning data into clear visual insights and presenting results in a professional way.
