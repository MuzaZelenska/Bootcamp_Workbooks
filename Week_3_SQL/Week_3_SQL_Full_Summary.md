# Week 3 -SQL

During the third week of the **Just IT Data Technician Bootcamp**, I learned the fundamentals of **SQL** and how to work with relational databases.  
I explored **database design**, including creating tables, setting primary and foreign keys, and building relationships between tables such as *Products*, *Customers*, *Sales*, and *SaleItems*.  
I practised writing **SQL queries** to select, filter, sort, and join data, as well as calculate values and use conditions.

I also completed several practical tasks using the **world_db** dataset, such as finding the most populated city, the country with the highest life expectancy, cities with populations between certain ranges, and sorting results using `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`.  
By the end of the week, I gained confidence in creating and managing databases, writing SQL queries, and analysing data from multiple tables.
