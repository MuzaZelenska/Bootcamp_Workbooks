# Week 5 Project - Python

During the fifth week of the **Just IT Data Technician Bootcamp**, I learned how to use **Python** for data analysis and automation.  
I started with simple coding tasks such as **FizzBuzz**, where I practised loops, conditions, and logic.  
Then, I worked with real datasets in **Pandas**, learning how to load CSV files, explore data, and perform common operations like filtering, sorting, grouping, and aggregating.  

I also created new calculated columns, such as *“passed”* and *“grade”*, and saved the results into new CSV files.  
Finally, I used **Matplotlib** to visualise data with **pie charts** that showed the distribution of grades and gender.  
By the end of the week, I was able to clean, transform, and visualise data in Python confidently.
