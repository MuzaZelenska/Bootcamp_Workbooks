Just IT Data Technician Bootcamp — Summary

This portfolio summarises my learning journey through the Just IT Data Technician Bootcamp, where I developed practical skills in Excel, Tableau & Power BI, SQL, Azure, and Python. Each week focused on a different part of the data workflow — from collecting and cleaning data to analysing, visualising, and presenting it using modern tools.

### Week 1 — Excel

I completed the Just IT Data Technician Bootcamp, where I learned how to work with data step by step. During the course, I practised collecting, cleaning, and analysing datasets in Excel.

Learned about common laws and regulations that must be followed when working with customers’ data (Data Protection Act, GDPR, Freedom of Information Act, Computer Misuse Act).

- What each law is about  
- Why it is important  
- A real-world example of how to follow it  
- How it impacts working with data  
- What could happen if it is breached

Worked with the retail-sales_dataset.xlsx file — sorted data, used the SUM and AVERAGE functions, applied filters to show top results, used the MAX and SWITCH functions, and applied conditional formatting. Created a pivot table and learned how to use it to analyse and visualise data effectively.

Created different types of charts — a line chart, a pie chart, and a column chart — and learned how to use them. I discovered that data visualisation supports analysis and interpretation by clearly showing patterns, relationships, and trends.

Learned what primary and foreign keys are, and how they are related. Provided real-world examples of one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships.

Understood the difference between relational and non-relational databases.

Researched different types of SQL JOINs: self join, right join, full join, inner join, cross join, and left join.

**Database Design Project**

In a group task, we were asked to design a database system for a small retail business that sells groceries and household products. The goal was to plan how the database would manage inventory, sales, and customer information, including a loyalty programme.

We discussed and described:

- Business requirements – identifying key data to store (products, customers, sales, loyalty points)  
- Database schema design – creating main tables (Products, Customers, Sales, SaleItems) and defining relationships using primary and foreign keys  
- SQL implementation – examples of CREATE TABLE, INSERT, and JOIN statements  
- Maintenance plan – checking data quality, saving backups, managing user access, and keeping information secure

**Final SQL Task**  
I completed a series of real-world scenarios using SQL queries to explore and analyse demographic and economic data from a global cities database.

The exercises included:

- Counting and filtering cities by population, region, and name patterns  
- Identifying the most and least populated cities and countries  
- Calculating averages and population densities  
- Selecting and sorting data with specific limits  
- Using aggregate functions (COUNT, AVG, MAX, MIN) and conditional filters (WHERE, BETWEEN, LIKE, ORDER BY, LIMIT)

By the end of the week, I gained confidence in creating and managing databases, writing SQL queries, and analysing data from multiple tables.

**Skill List**

- Database design and structure  
- Creating tables and defining primary and foreign keys  
- Writing SQL queries (SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, LIMIT)  
- Using JOINs to combine data from multiple tables  
- Filtering, sorting, and aggregating data  
- Inserting and updating records in databases  
- Understanding relationships (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many)  
- Performing aggregate queries and grouping results  
- Analysing real-world datasets to extract insights

### Week 4 — Microsoft Azure

During the fourth week of the Just IT Data Technician Bootcamp, I focused on learning about Microsoft Azure and how cloud services support modern data management. I studied different types of clouds (public, private, hybrid, community) and cloud service models such as IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS, learning how businesses use them in real-world situations. I also explored UK data protection laws, including the Computer Misuse Act, GDPR, and the Data Protection Act 2018, understanding how they support the safe use of digital data.

**Wrote the code:**

- to import CSV files into DataFrames  
- to display the first 5 rows of a DataFrame  
- to get information and summary statistics about a DataFrame  
- to select specific columns and rows  
- to add a new column based on a condition  
- to rename and drop columns  
- to group a DataFrame by a column and calculate the mean mark for each group  
- to count the number of students in each class  
- to calculate the average mark for each gender  
- to create a pivot table  
- to sort a DataFrame by the ‘mark’ column  
- to save a DataFrame to a new CSV file  

**Pie Chart Development Process**

I created a series of pie charts in Python using Matplotlib to visualise student performance by grades and gender. The project went through four main versions, each adding new features and improving the design and readability.

- **Version 1 – Basic Chart:** Created a simple pie chart showing gender distribution and percentages.
- **Version 2 – First Grade Chart:** Added grade distribution (A, B, C, D), new colours, rounded percentages, and rotation from top clockwise.
- **Version 3 – Adding Style and Legend:** Set manual colours, changed font, added legend, and improved background.
