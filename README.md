\# Just IT Data Technician Bootcamp — Summary



This portfolio summarises my learning journey through the \*\*Just IT Data Technician Bootcamp\*\*, where I developed practical skills in \*\*Excel, Tableau \& Power BI, SQL, Azure, and Python\*\*.  

Each week focused on a different part of the data workflow — from collecting and cleaning data to analysing, visualising, and presenting it using modern tools.

\- \*\*Maintenance plan:\*\* checking data quality, making backups, managing user access, and keeping information secure  



\#### Final SQL Task

I completed a series of real-world queries to explore and analyse demographic and economic data from a global cities database:

\- Counting and filtering cities by population, region, and name patterns  

\- Identifying the most and least populated cities and countries  

\- Calculating averages and population densities  

\- Selecting and sorting data with limits  

\- Using aggregate functions (`COUNT`, `AVG`, `MAX`, `MIN`) and filters (`WHERE`, `BETWEEN`, `LIKE`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`)  



\### Skill List
